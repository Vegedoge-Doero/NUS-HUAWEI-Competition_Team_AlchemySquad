The programs contain several parts. Taking the LSTM_Attention_20classes/Alchemy Squad_SourceCode/ folder as an example, they are:
1. Neural network schemes (NNclass.py);
2. Model training (myTrainModel_json.py);
3. Real-time trading process (myModel_test_multiple_20230317.py) with pre-trained model (CSV99_LSTM_class20_checkpoint200.pth.tar);

To run the program.

There are two versions of the
